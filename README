Sys-Mlockall version 0.01
=========================

This module provides a quick-and-dirty interface to the mlockall() and
munlockall() system calls. mlockall() can be used to prevent your process's
memory from being placed in swap, which can be useful for scripts that
deal with sensitive information (passwords / RSA keys / stardrive plans / etc).

INSTALLATION

Note that running the unit tests requires root permissions, and also requires
that the BSD::Resource module be installed.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

LICENCE

at your option, any later version of Perl 5 you may have available.
